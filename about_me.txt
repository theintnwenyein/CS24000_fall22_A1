Hello! My name is Theint, and I am a freshman majoring in Computer Science. I became interested in Computer Science when I took CS classes during high school. As I took CSCI23000 last semester, I have experiences in python, and html & css. My current short term goal before my junior year would be to find the field I am interested in so that I know which specialization I want to pursue.
